            Arbitrage in cryptocurrencies involves buying and selling the same
            digital asset across different exchanges to take advantage of price
            discrepancies. Traders can exploit temporary market inefficiencies
            by acquiring a cryptocurrency at a lower price on one platform and
            selling it at a higher price on another, thereby securing a
            risk-free profit. This strategy contributes to market efficiency by
            helping to synchronize prices across various cryptocurrency
            exchanges.
